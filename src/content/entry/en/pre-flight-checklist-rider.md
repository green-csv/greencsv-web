Every time I start or pull a .NET project in JetBrains Rider I run this short checklist. It kills most environment-specific bugs that have burned me, especially with Blazor + WASM.

- **Namespace provider**  
	Mark each `src/` folder as a Namespace provider (right-click folder → **Mark Directory As → Namespace Provider**).

- **MSBuild version (Windows Only)**  
	force Rider to use the exact MSBuild that ships with Visual Studio. A minor-version mismatch spawns divergent assets and mysterious warnings.

- **.NET CLI path**  
	Verify the `dotnet` executable active, multiple SDKs + Rider’s bundled runtime can lead to mismatches (e.g. `*.blazor.css` not resolving).

Anything else to add?
