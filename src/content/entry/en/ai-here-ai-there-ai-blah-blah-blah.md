In today’s AI discourse, we’re inundated with sweeping claims and fleeting trends vying for our attention.

It’s increasingly common to see publications confidently proclaiming new, “definitive” guidelines or methodologies in the field. Faced with this overabundance, fatigue is inevitable; I join the conversation from a reflective stance, not claiming any expert authority.

My background in systems engineering exposed me to key algorithms—heuristic search, evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning with Q-learning—and other relevant approaches.

Focusing exclusively on AI isn’t my usual practice; however, over time I’ve watched the field evolve. The emergence of new research areas and the tangible progress of the last decade speak for themselves, sparking my ongoing interest in the subject.

From my comprehensive view point in software development, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern: sometimes we rely on reasoning, and other times we follow the crowd’s excitement. It’s like the cycles of “Clean Code is amazing!” only to swing to “Forget Clean Code; Vertical Slice is the way!” This spiral of collective enthusiasm shows how we embrace trends without questioning their purpose, which ultimately dilutes technical discourse.

ChatGPT turned castles in the air for many mortals into a solid foundation for generative AI—giving rise both to experts and opportunists.

But this so-called novelty isn’t entirely new. Carl Sagan, in _The Dragons of Eden_ (1977), proposed that the next major structural leap in human intelligence would likely come from the union of intelligent human minds and intelligent machines.

My professional journey is rooted in the .NET ecosystem—a choice driven by work opportunities that soon evolved into a critical conviction. I strive for a reflective adoption of technology, guided by architectural patterns designed to endure beyond the latest buzz.

Now, AI experts seem to be around every corner—just as specialist developers once were in other domains.

The field of artificial intelligence is advancing at a strange, exhilarating pace, but that speed carries a risk for anyone skating along the surface: the risk of getting lost in each new trend without building a lasting understanding. That’s why it’s crucial to cultivate a sustained research mindset: keep your curiosity alive, discern what truly matters, and decide deliberately which knowledge to integrate into your professional—and why not, personal—practice.

Seek the essentials, choose your knowledge wisely, and chart an authentic path—far from the inertia of the next wave.
